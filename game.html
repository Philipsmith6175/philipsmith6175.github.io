                Good Choice!
  You have successfully reached the second stage, which entails that the home page was fathomable enough for you to click "Start Challenge".  Now, without wasting any more time, let's get to the challenge, play, & make money part!.   
How it Works!
  There's series of games on this site if you scroll down you can either play it online or play it on your phone if you have it installed. Before that! you have to register an account with us, so to open an account there's a link to chat with us at the end part of this page.          Kindly click the link to chat with our support, get registered for 1,000 naira & get a bonus of 1,000 forüá≥üá¨.  Outside Nigeria will get not less than 10$. Trust me, this is not the only bonus you will get.  This is because you will have your own space on the website, & also you will have your personal website where you can check your scores, wins, & loses on the website. Most especially your account balance on the website in which you will withdraw after the due date you selected. 
   After opening an account, you will challenge someone to play a game with & drop your challenge token. This person will also open an account & drop his challenge token. I.E if you drop 1,000. & your opponent also drops 1,000. The winner will collect 2,000. & the looser gets nothing.  THIS MONEY WON'T BE WITHDRAWN INSTANTLY! While registering, you are to select when to be paid. The least is 5 days after opening an account. So it's either 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, a month.. e.t.c 
    This is because the website wants a large earning for the users, imagine you playing games for 5 days & you won every single game from Monday till Friday. Once you receive your credit alert, it will be something HOOOOGE! Please take note that for every challenge there is a token.  However, you might've been wondering how the website is going to know the winner & the looser, well, once you chat with the support manager you will be told to make a screen record of how you play the game. Moreso, it is more fun if you select an opponent physically, this is someone who is close to you. Not Online closeness per say. If you're playing subway surf, the person with the highest coins / highest score is the WINNERüèÜ. 
  If you're playing a football match DLS! The one who scores the highest goal is the WINNER. If both party looses, you have lost to the website automatically. More questions, thoughts, opinions maybe on your mind as you read  this may pop up, so you can always chat with support at the end of this page. 
     Be informed that most games doesn't require online multiplaying, you are to bring your opponent to register also & drop the token you both agreed on. Also, if it's a running game you can always record your part down & let your opponent record his part, both recordings will be submitted to the support & the decision will be made. You can always check your score on your personal website booked with the support.  Thank you!
