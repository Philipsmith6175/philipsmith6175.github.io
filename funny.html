 <strong> (Comedy, action)Scary MovieüòÇ PLOT:Defying the very notion of good taste, Scary Movie out-parodies the pop culture parodies with a no-holds barred assault on the most popular images and talked-about moments from recent films, television and commercials. The film boldly fires barbs at the classic scenes from "Scream," "The Sixth Sense," "The Matrix," "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "The Blair Witch Project," then goes on to mock a whole myriad of teen movie clich√©s, no matter the genre.</strong>
